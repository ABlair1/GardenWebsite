    <h1>Watch Your Garden Grow and Enjoy!</h1>

        <p class="text-content">
            At this point, we will assume that you waited until all risk of frost has passed, and you 
            have planted your seedlings outside. Congrats! Great job! Now what next? 
        </p>
        <h2>Check the Garden Daily</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            This part of the year is my favorite time in the garden, aside from when we actually get 
            to eat everything! This is when you can begin the daily routine of greeting the morning with 
            a quick visit to the garden. If mornings don't work for you, anytime of day is a good time to 
            check on the plants. Mornings are great because it's not too hot out yet, and we can water 
            the plants and get them ready to greet the sun. You can also use this opportunity to look for 
            pests and take general inventory of the wellbeing of each plant. Do they look happy, or do they 
            look sad? I define "sad" here as meaning there is something visibly wrong with a plant. 
            After checking in, you can plan how you will approach any work you need to do in the garden and 
            when you will do it. 
        </p>

            Above and below are photos of my raised beds from summer 2020. It may seem surprising, 
            but each shows the same bed early in the summer and a little further into the growing 
            season. Large and unruly plants, like the tomatoes in the raised bed photos below, can 
            grow fast and totally take over an area if they are not supported by a trellis or stakes. 
            We actualy had to prune these tomato plants because they became too overgrown for the 
            space and would not stop putting out new branches for most of the season.

        <h2 class="subheading">Watering Approaches and Routines</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Your plants need water, but not too little or too much. Keeping a simple rain gauge will 
            help you track how much rain they have had recently, and when you should water them. 
            For example, if it rains at night, you probably don't need to get up and water in the 
            morning, or maybe at all that day. Has it been dry all week? Then you should make sure 
            you're watering when the soil gets dry. How do you know when the soil is dry? I like to 
            stick my fingers in the dirt and just check by touch. If its dry a few inches down, 
            then those roots are probably thirsty. Alternatively, if the soil is moist, hold off 
            on watering so that you don't drown the plants. It doesn't have to be any more complicated 
            than that, just stay consistent and check each day. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Look Out for Pests and Problems</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Pests, such as insects and animals, can be a real pain in the neck. Nothing is worse than 
            waiting for your first tomato to become perfectly ripe, only to go outside and find a 
            tomato hornworm has already beat you to it. If you do find pests, don't panic, you can 
            get rid of them. In almost all cases, only use chemical sprays as a last resort or in 
            extreme cases. There are many natural rememdies which can be effective for controlling 
            insect populations, and if your garden is small enough, you can just pick them off by hand 
            and dispose of them. Don't forget there are also beneficial insects around and pollinators, 
            and the last thing we want to do is harm them while trying to get rid of a minor pest like 
            aphids or something similar. Physical barriers, such as fencing, can be effective for many 
            animals, including rabbits and deer. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Enjoy Your Harvests!</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            This is the best part! As much as I'm sure we all love pulling weeds and obsessively
            searching under leaves for aphids, eating vegetables is pretty darn good. That's the
            whole reason why you're doing this, right!? (Note: If your primary motivation for gardening
            is to walk around your yard contemplating your choices, there are probably less involved
            hobbies that will get you there). Harvesting is easy, but we will share a few tips for
            getting the most out of your veggies.

        <h4>Pick Vegetables When They Are Ready</h4>
        <p class="text-content">
            This may seem obvious, but don't hesitate to pick vegetables when they
            are ready. Many plant types will stop or slow vegetable production if you don't harvest what
            they've grown. For example, pole beans and bush beans can grow FAST when the weather is right.
            If the beans are left on the plant, they will not try nearly as hard to keep producing.
            If you go out and pick beans every day, then they will keep up with demand and keep growing
            more and more. Other crops such as cucumbers, peppers, and many more will behave this way.
            If you're havesting everything when it is ready, then you won't run into this problem and
            it won't matter which plants exhibit this behavior. Don't short change yourself. You've
            worked hard to get to this point, so you might as well get all you can out of your plants.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            Are you wondering when exactly your vegetables are "ready"? It all depends! Different
            species of vegetables grow and ripen in a wide variety of ways, and different varieties
            within the same species can also vary widely. Not all tomatoes produce fruit at the same
            speed, or of the same size (obviously). The best practice is to stay informed of what
            you're looking for with the specific plants you've grown. Most seed packets and plant tags
            from reputable suppliers will list time windows for plant growth and vegetable growth, and
            also guidelines for when vegetables should be harvested. For example, we have grown a variety
            of pattypan squash and the seed packet recommends harvesting when they are approximately
            3 inches in diameter. This is when they will be most tender and have the best flavor.
            Letting the squash grow larger and older can lead to the skin becoming tough, many seeds
            developing inside, and the flesh of the squash not being as tasty. Do yourself a favor and
            pick and eat your produce as soon as it is mature and ready.

        <h4>How to Use Everything</h4>
        <p class="text-content">
            If you've been ambitious with your garden, and are harvesting large amounts of vegetables,
            you may find yourself staring at an entire dining room table full of cucumbers and thinking
            "What am I supposed to do with all this?" This is a great problem to have!
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            Below is a short list of ideas for using extra veggies: <br>
        <ul class="text-content">
            <li>Give them away to friends, family, and neighbors.</li>
            <li>Try pickling some (I prefer a super easy "quick pickle" method).
                <ul>
                    <li>You can pickle much more than cucumbers.</li>
                    <li>Squash, carrots, peppers, string beans, and the list goes on!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Freeze and enjoy them after the growing season.</li>
            <li>Dry or dehydrate them for a long shelf life.
                <ul>
                    <li>This works best with herbs and spicy peppers (in my experience).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

            <h4 class="scroll-heading">Hey Pepperheads!</h4>
            <div class="image-content">

            <p class="text-content scroll-text">
                Do you love hot peppers, hot sauces, and anything spicy!? You can grow more hot peppers than you'll
                know what to do with! When growing your own peppers, you won't be limited to just the few varieties
                found in a grocery store. Ordering seeds online is a great way to have access to all kinds of
                unusual
                and delicious varieties. Pepper plants can produce a lot, and small amounts of hot peppers can go a
                long way. Luckily, it is easy to dry your own hot peppers for a long shelf life.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="text-content scroll-text">
                You can buy a food dehydrator to make the process foolproof, or you can dry them in the oven on low
                heat for several hours. We save our extra hot peppers by placing them whole on a sheet pan in the
                oven at 175 degrees F for 2-4 hours. Leave the oven door cracked, with a spoon or something holding
                it open, to allow moisture to escape. The peppers are done when they are completely crisp and dry,
                and you can hear the dry seeds rattling around inside of them. Then just allow them to cool and
                store in air-tight jars or containers. You can also crush them up to mke your own hot pepper flakes.
