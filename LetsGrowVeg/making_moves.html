    <h1>Making Moves in Your Garden</h1>
    <section>
        <p class="text-content">The moment has finally arrived! Now you can get your hands dirty and set
            your garden in motion. Ideally, you've been eagerly planning and reading all winter and spring
            is right around the corner. If that is not the case, and it is already spring or summer as
            you're reading this, don't worry! You can still get ready for a late summer and early fall
            crop, which can vary depending on your location (more on that below). However, for our
            purposes, we will assume that you are going to plant your garden in the spring. </p>
        <h2>Soil and Nutrients</h2>
        <p class="text-content">It's what plants crave! We will assume that you've picked a nice sunny
            spot where your plants can get all the solar energy they could ever want, and that you are
            watering them appropriately. Let's talk about the other things they will need to grow.</p>
        <p class="text-content">
            Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium/potash (commonly referred to as N-P-K) are the primary 
            nutrients that plants need to grow and produce. Most fertilizers focus on these big three 
            to give plants much of the food they will need. There are also many trace nutrients and 
            minerals that are vitally important to plants, such as calcium, magnesium, etc., but we will 
            not go into that here. N, P, and K should be the first thing you learn about in regards to 
            plant nutrition. Soil pH is equally as important! If soil is too acidic (low) or basic (high), 
            then plants will not be able to absorb the nutrients that are in the soil. Many plants do 
            well somewhere between 6.0 and 7.5 on the pH scale, but you should definitely research what is 
            best for your chosen plants. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            To determine the pH and nutrient levels of your soil, you have a couple of options. If you're 
            serious about gardening, I would recommend having a credible soil lab test a sample of your 
            garden soil before adding any fertilizer or ammendments. I am on the east coast of the U.S. and 
            my preferred lab is at the University of Delaware. There is probably a university closer to you 
            where you can have a test performed. Often this consists of sending a couple small bags of soil 
            through the mail and getting a full report back some weeks later. You can also perform an at-home 
            soil test using a kit (pictured below). These kits are not at all as accurate as a lab test, but 
            they can be useful for giving you a very general snapshot of what is going on. Last year I sent 
            my soil to lab, but this year I decided to try a test kit. Test kits can also be used throughout 
            the growing season to measure how conditions change over time. Seen below, I have enlarged the 
            images of my results from the test kit for clarity. Comparing the results to the provided scales, 
            we can see that this sample was deficient in nitrogen, but the other values were acceptable. 
            This lets us know how much fertilizer to use, and of what type.

        <h2 class="subheading">When to Plant</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Ideally, the best time to plant outdoors in when the last risk of frost has passed. This can vary 
            widely by your geographic location. Assuming you live in the U.S., the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
            provides a <a target="_blank" href="https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/">Plant Hardiness Zone Map</a>. 
            This resource lets users look up the average minimum temperature in their area. Often, hardiness zones 
            will also correlate with last dates of frost. In this way, you can look up when to plant in your area. 
            No matter where you live, you can get a jump on the season by starting seedlings indoors several weeks 
            before the last frost. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Starting Seeds Indoors</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            If you're going to buy started plants, you can skip over the rest of this page and head to the next one. 
            Otherwise, lets talk about seeds! Hopefully, you have seeds picked out from a supplier already and 
            you're ready to rock! Now look at those seed packets, or online if they haven't arrived yet. Many seed 
            seed packets will list recommendations for when and how to plant them. For example, one of my tomato 
            varieties says to start indoors, 6 to 8 weeks before outdoor night temperatures are around 55 degrees F. 
            Then the package goes on to recommend sowing seeds 0.25 inches deep and one inch apart, and provides 
            further directions. Just do whatever your seed packets recommend! It is that simple!
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            When starting seeds indoors, you must provide them with a growing light specifically designed for 
            plants. This will provide the strong light needed to start seeds and get them going on the right foot 
            (or root). Many companies sell a soil mix specifically for starting seeds, and these work well, but you 
            could also mix peat moss and perlite in a 2:1 ratio and your plants would be fine. Seeds come packaged 
            naturaly with all the nutrients they will need to start life, right in their little seed pods. When they 
            have grown a few sets of leaves, then you can transplant them and provide fertilizer.

        <h2 class="subheading">Starting Seeds Outdoors</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Some plant seeds do best when sown directly in the ground, and struggle when started inside and transplanted. 
            Or maybe you just didn't get around to starting those seeds back in March or April, that is ok too! Follow 
            the directions on the seed packets the same as we discussed above. Some packets will have different recommendations 
            for starting outdoors. When the weather is warm and it is sunny, they will sprout before you know it! 
            Below you can find seeds that I started outdoors this year (2021).
