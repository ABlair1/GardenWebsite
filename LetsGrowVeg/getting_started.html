    <h1>Getting Started with Your Garden</h1>
    <section>
        <p class="text-content">
            Welcome! If you're here, then you're interested in learning more about gardening and
            getting some green on your thumbs. Don't worry, it's a lot easier than you may think!
            The most important thing is having an interest and enjoying yourself. Let's jump in!
        </p>
        <h2>Garden Types</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Home gardens can range in size and type from over an acre in crops, to herbs in a window
            box, and everything in between. No matter the space or resources you have available, there
            is almost always some sort of garden that will be a perfect fit for you.
        </p>
        <h4>Traditional Rows</h4>
        <p class="text-content">
            When talking about traditional rows, I mean any planting that is done at ground level and in
            a space that is specially set aside only for growing vegetables. This is what you may think
            of when you picture a farm. While it may seem like a lot, row
            planting doesn't have to be intimidating. You do not have to plant a whole field of crops.
            Rows also don't have to be in big rectangular plots. You can plant a row anywhere there is
            space available. You could convert some flower beds, or create new rows in an unused space
            at the edge of your yard, for example. I'd recommend rows that are 2-3 feet wide and as long
            as you would like. The quality of soil and how it is managed can also affect how well this
            option could work for you.
        </p>

        <h4>Containers</h4>
        <p class="text-content">
            Containers offer many benefits and could be anything from terra cotta pots to plastic five
            gallon buckets, repurposed storage bins, or simple wooden boxes of any size. Containers are
            defined by having an enclosed bottom that is not in direct contact with the ground. They may
            or may not be on raised platforms or stands, depending on their size and location. Whatever
            your container, make sure there are holes in the bottom so that water can easily drain out
            and not drown plant roots. Personally, I
            love growing in fabric pots. They are made from a woven textile that allows air exchange with
            the soil in the pot and for excess water to drain freely without the need for holes in the
            bottom.

        <h4>Raised Beds</h4>
        <p class="text-content">
            Raised beds are the best of both worlds when compared to row planting and containers. They
            can be thought of as a large container of sorts, which has no bottom at all, and thus allows
            plants to freely interact with the living soil in the ground. They can offer greater control
            for a gardener than planting at ground level, and without the constraints of containers.

        <h2 class="subheading">Deciding What to Grow</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            This is pretty straightforward. What do you want to grow? In order to answer that question,
            it's important to think about any potential limitations you may have. For example, if you
            try to grow a squash plant in a small pot on your patio, you will be very disappointed
            with the outcome. However, herbs such as oregano or thyme could thrive in such a container.
            I'd suggest figuring out what type of garden you want and how much space you're working with,
            then move on to deciding which plants you'll grow there.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content">
            Order a seed catalogue or go online to a reputable seed company's website. Browse the
            available options and see what conditions each plant needs to thrive. A good company will
            list plant spacing and size, ideal growing conditions, and give you an idea about what to
            expect. Then you will be free to either order seeds online or just make a list of plants
            you want. You could take this plant list to a local nursery to buy seedlings that have
            already been started for you (which makes life easy). Before that, however, continue
            reading on and figure out a plan for the big picture.

        <h2 class="subheading">Choosing a Location</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
            Do you know which locations around your property get the most sunlight throughout the day? If not, now is 
            the time to find out! Most vegetable plants require 8 to 12 hours of sunlight daily. If you have a lot of 
            trees on your proerty, or other buildings shade out much of your yard, this can be problematic. If your 
            plants don't get enough light, they may not become very robust or produce much. My advice is to look 
            around the property early in the morning one day and find the sunny spots. Then check back every few hours 
            and take note of how the sunny spots change throughout the day, all the way until sunset. Then just choose 
            the spots that get the most light and are in a workable location (you need to be able to access your garden 
            after all).
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Additional Information</h2>
        <p class="text-content">

                Bible</em> (Smith, 2009)</a>. It is an invaluable reference for everything you could ever want to know about
            vegetable gardens, and will provide more useful information than I would ever be able to
            give here. However, this site is free to read! Buy the book if you'd like a more in-depth
            exploration on gardening.
